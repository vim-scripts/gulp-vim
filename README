Usage
=====

Gulp-vim provides 2 main commands: Gulp and GulpExt.

Both commands accept 0 or many arguments (Task name(s)), that can be completed using <Tab>.

:Gulp    [task(s)...]
:GulpExt [task(s)...]

If no task name was provided, 'default' is used.

The difference between those 2 commands is that Gulp executes gulp inside Vim and GulpExt open an external terminal (The default one via exo-open in Unix and a simple cmd in Windows) or uses Dispatch, then execute gulp.

Don't use gulp watching tasks with the command Gulp (In case, <Ctrl-C> to stop it), use GulpExt for those tasks.

Using:
:CtrlpGulp
You can execute gulp tasks with CtrlP (This command is provided only if ctrlp is installed). 

:GulpTasks                      => To show a list of your gulp task names (Extracted from current gulpfile.js).
:GulpFile [gulpfile]         => To specify the gulpfile to use: gulpfile.coffee, gulpfile.babel.js (By default its gulpfile.js).
